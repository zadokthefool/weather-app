Pets at Home Technical Challenge: Build a Weather App

Objective:
frontend development skills, ability to consume APIs, handle data, create responsive UI, and apply best practices in frontend development.
In Next.js and TypeScript.

Instructions:
Build a weather application that allows users to search for the current weather conditions of a city.
You are required to use the WeatherAPI service (https://www.weatherapi.com/) to retrieve weather
data.

Requirements:
The user interface should consist of at least two components: a search bar and a weather display
section. 

The search bar should allow users to enter the name of a city and initiate a search.
Upon a successful search, display the current weather conditions of the city, including temperature,
humidity, wind speed and any of the other properties.
Try to make it visually appealing and responsive.

Write clean, maintainable, and well-structured code, following best practices and industry
standards.
Use Git for version control and provide a GitHub repository link containing your code.
Bonus (optional):
Deploy the app to a hosting provider like Vercel so we can preview the app without having to run
locally.
Implement error handling for cases such as failed API requests or invalid city names.
Add unit tests using tools like Jest, React Testing Library, Mocha, Chai, Enzyme etc. (2-3 tests would
suffice)

Submission:
Share the link to your GitHub repository.

Note: Feel free to use any additional libraries or tools
